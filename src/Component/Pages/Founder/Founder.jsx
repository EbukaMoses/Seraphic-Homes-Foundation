            <h1>Evang. Chukwuebuka Obi</h1>
            <span>FOUNDER & MISSION BEARER</span>
            <p>
              All Human beings are born equal, but our gifts, callings, divine
              elections and predestinations vary. Born a twin to the staunch
              Roman Catholic family of Mr and Mrs Vincent Obi of Ubulu-Ihejifor
              in Oru-West L.G.A Imo State, Nigeria. Evangelist Chukwuebuka
              Anozie Obi is a powerful man of God who with grace, commitment and
              passion serves as the founder and spiritual director of Zion
              Prayer Movement Outreach (ZPMO), located in Ago-okota, Lagos,
              Nigeria. He is a strong reflection of Luke 4:18, whose life is
              dedicated to living by example and encouraging men and women to
              live up to their full potentials in Christ. At the tender age of
              8, young Chukwuebuka's spiritual gifts began to manifest. He would
              give prophecies to people known and unknown to him and it would
              come to pass just as he had prophesied. This caused many from
              different places to troop into his father's compound in search of
              this gifted lad. After his education, he went off to Lagos for
              greener pastures which he hoped would be more favorable and
              beneficial to him as a young man. But this didn't extinguish the
              fire of the Holy Spirit burning in him as the fire was
              unquenchable and so, it kept on burning. Although he got fully
              established in a thriving cable business, he was still unsatisfied
              and unfulfilled. He kept on living his normal life until one
              momentous morning, he heard a strong voice echoing into his ears
              that he had the anointing of the Holy Spirit running down his head
              (with the bible verse Isaiah 61:1) instructing him to shut down
              his business and go into full time evangelism. Complying with this
              instruction was quite arduous and backbreaking as his family was
              antagonistic. Alas, it came to pass and ZPMO was born. From
              inception till date, thousands of people from far and wide pour in
              to worship and different miracles and testimonies are recorded on
              a daily basis. Denominational discrimination has no bearing on his
              mandate or anointing. He cherishes his call in bringing forth the
              uncompromising word of God and the gift upon his life has blessed
              so many immeasurably..
